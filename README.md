# Nubes

_Weather app_, I choose this project to use some of my personal stack + updating an old project that was deprecated completely. You can pick any city in the whole world so the app can give you the weather information of this city that you looked for.

## API

I used the free weather api from this website: (WeatherAPI)[https://weatherapi.com]

## Stack

I used **React.js** as the front-end library with **TailwindCSS** for styling, **React Router** for the navigation of the website, **formik** for easy manipulation of the events, handlers, values in form, and **framer-motion** for animations.
